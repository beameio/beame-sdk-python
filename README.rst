beame-sdk-python
================

Beame.io SDK for the Python language. Currently implements token creation and validation functionality only.

For now, `Full Beame.io SDK <https://github.com/beameio/beame-sdk>`_ is only for NodeJS.

The Beame SDK allows you to establish an HTTPS session between machines without public IPs. This SDK  allows you to create credentials and use them to identify machines. It’s a simple way to use encryption-based identity in web and mobile applications. This transparent security infrastructure can be used in any network, global or local, to create credentials, bind them to users’ hardware, and get strong, crypto-based authentication. This mitigates risk for services that host credentials to require users to prove identity.
